### ABSTRACT
__Time Series Forcasting with Keras: LSTM vs ConvNN__

When we look for examples of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), they usually concern natural language processing. Similarly, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNN) usually concern image processing. As such, most popular applications of deep learning are not time series forecasting. How can we then effectively apply these methods to time series forecasting? To answer this I have built hourly solar generation forecasts with different methods in Keras. As a practitioner in the power utility industry, I will talk about different deep learning architectures suitable for time series forecasting and how they compare to traditional statistical methods.
